## Output
```
original machine probabilities: [0.2, 0.5, 0.75]
mean estimate for machine 0: 0.26153846153846155
mean estimate for machine 1: 0.45625
mean estimate for machine 2: 0.7521988136633248
total reward earned:  7443.0
overall win rate:  0.7443
number of times each machine selected [65.0, 160.0, 9778.0]
```

we can see that each machine's estimated mean is more closer to their true mean,
this will suggest that we probably play these machines more often than we should have.
